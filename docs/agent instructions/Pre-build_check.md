## It is time for another build. Please do the following for me:

1. Scan code for any redundancy, errors, or code cleanup
2. Identify any logical potential errors and notify me
3. Generate the Update Release file based on the changes below, and increment the init version number. 
4. Run the tests, fix any errors, and build

Note this is a breaking change from the previous full release.
It includes:
1. Full Chinese (and Japanese) Language Support. Toggle between them  with no issues
2. Optimized sentences to prioritize ideal length
