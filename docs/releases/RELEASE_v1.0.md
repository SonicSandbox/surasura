# 🎉 Surasura v1.0 Release

**We are thrilled to announce the official v1.0 release of Surasura (スラスラ) - The Readability Analyzer!**

Surasura is a tool designed for intermediate-to-advanced Japanese learners who want to optimize their vocabulary acquisition. Stop wasting time on words you'll never see again—Surasura analyzes your specific immersion content (Books, TV shows, Subtitles) and prioritizes vocabulary based on frequency *within that content* and your existing known words.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Prioritization
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Calculates the "leverage" of every word based on how often it appears in your specific library vs. general frequency.
- **Migaku Integration**: Import your known words directly from Migaku. Version 1.0 features a **simplified one-line command** to extract your database directly from the browser!
- **Progress Tracking**: See your "Readability Score" for every book/episode before you even start.

### 📂 Multi-Format Support
- **EPUB & Text**: dragging and dropping a folder of books? No problem.
- **SRT Subtitles**: Automatically filters timestamps and English lines to analyze just the Japanese dialogue.
- **Recursive Scanning**: Point it at a folder, and it finds every compatible file inside.

### 💎 Polished Learning Experience
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A beautiful, responsive HTML report to review words.
- **Zen Mode**: A distraction-free viewing mode. In v1.0, the logo fades to near-invisible transparency to keep you focused on the content.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Breeze through word cards using `Left`/`Right` arrow keys or `Space`. (Now with a helpful on-screen hint!)
- **Manage Content**: Easily manage your Ignore List and input files directly from the GUI.

### 🛠️ Robustness
- **Sentence-Aware Splitting**: Intelligently splits text at sentence boundaries for natural context examples.
- **Cross-Platform Foundation**: Built on Python 3.9+, compatible with Windows (packaged exe) and runnable from source on macOS/Linux.
