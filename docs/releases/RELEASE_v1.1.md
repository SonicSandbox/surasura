# Surasura - Readability Analyzer v1.1

Major update focused on usability, data management, and visual polish!

## 🌟 Highlights

### 📦 Full Content Manager
A new dedicated interface to manage your immersion materials.
- **Import Manager**: Easily add `.txt`, `.epub`, `.srt`, or `.md` files.
- **Priority sorting**: Organize content into `High Priority`, `Low Priority`, and `Goal Content` folders directly from the app.
- **Clean interface**: See file counts and manage your library without leaving the tool.

### 🎯 % Coverage Mode
A new analysis strategy!
- instead of just filtering by frequency, you can now generate a vocabulary list based on **Target Coverage**.
- *Example:* "I want to reach 90% comprehension of this book." -> The tool will generate exactly the words you need to learn to hit that 90% mark.

### 📚 Streamlined Dictionary Import
- **Auto-Scan**: The importer now automatically finds the latest Migaku export in your Downloads folder.

### 🎨 Visual & Quality of Life Improvements
- **Theme Visibility**: Fixed text contrast issues in dark themes.
- **Window Management**: Windows are now properly resizable and remember their state better.
- **Escape Key**: Press `Esc` to quickly close meaningful secondary windows.

## 🛠️ Optimizations
- **Speed**: Core analyzer logic optimized for faster processing of large libraries.
- **Privacy**: Build process updated to ensure clean distribution (no developer data leaks).
