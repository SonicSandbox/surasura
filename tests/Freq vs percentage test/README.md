## A test for ensuring the priority metric works properly
This test uses the % Coverage analysis mode at 94%.
The test identifies if the logic is working properly. 

## How it works
The word ニーファイ is in both, however it should only show up in the analysis journey results in the test file 2, as the word doesn't make the target % cutoff in file 1. If it shows in file 1, the logic has changed or is incorrect.
